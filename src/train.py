        3. Train, or for each epoch:
                For each batch:
                - Choose which loss function
                - Freeze appropriate networks
                - Run through networks
                - Get loss
                - Update
                Metrics (like validation, etc)
        4. Return trained text & speech for validation, metric measurement
